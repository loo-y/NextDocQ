                Whisper is a game that is played by two people. One person is the guesser and the other is the
                whisperer. The whisperer is given a word and must whisper it to the guesser. The guesser must guess the
                word that the whisperer is whispering. The guesser is given 5 chances to guess the word. If the guesser
                guesses the word correctly, the whisperer wins. If the guesser does not guess the word correctly, the
                guesser wins.
